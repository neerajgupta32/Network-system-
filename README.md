# 🖧 Network System Simulation

This project showcases a simple but structured network system designed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes essential network components like routers, switches, PCs, and servers arranged in a small LAN/WAN topology. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate foundational networking concepts through hands-on simulation.

## 📚 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- IP Addressing (Static/Dynamic)
- Device Configuration (PCs, Switches, Routers)
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP and DNS Basics
- Packet Flow Analysis
- Basic Troubleshooting Tools (ping, tracert, etc.)

---

## 🖥️ Network Design Overview

The network topology includes:

- 🧩 **2 Routers** (interconnected for WAN simulation)
- 🖧 **2 Switches** connecting multiple PCs and a Server
- 🖥️ **4 End Devices** (PCs with static or DHCP IPs)
- 🌐 **1 Server** configured for DNS or Web hosting (optional)
- 🔁 Proper IP addressing scheme with subnetting

> The topology mimics a mini office or educational network setup.
